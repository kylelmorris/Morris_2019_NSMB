%VERSION  2.00
# Remember that the 2 previous lines are required,
# any other lines starting with # are comments.
# The number of generations is defined by an integer in the first
# 20 characters of the next, non-comment, line.
# No more comments allowed once data has started.
#
# %VERSION 2.00: Will allow comments at any position within the file. Any part
# of a line after a '#' character will considered a comment.It will also
# ignore blank lines.
#
# %VERSION 2.00: The tag END will denote the end of the library. No further
# lines will be considered. The line containing the END tag can only have the
# tag and blank characters or a comment.
#
# If the END tag is omitted the file will be process till the EOF and a warning
# will be issued.
#
# Each column in each generation must be space separated.
#
# Column Seed is and integer to seed the random generator. It is used.
#
# Column Parents Number. It the number of descriptor that will be used to 
# generate the Children of the current generation.
#
# Column Parents Energy. It the number of parent which will have their energy
# information printed.
#
# Column Parents Coord. The number of Parents which will have the coordinates
# printed to a file PDB or Mol2.
#
# Column Children Number: We tell BUDE how many Children to produce from
# the Parents. If the size of the generation is greater that 50% of the total
# it will be reduce to 50%.
# 
# Column Children Energy: Will tell BUDE how many descriptor info should 
# be output for the Children.
#
# Column Children Coord: Will tell BUDE how many Children will have their
# structural information written to a file.
#
# Column Mutation Method: Will tell BUDE how the descriptor should be generated.
# 1 will generated the requested number of descriptors and some maybe repeated.
# 2 will generated the requested number of descriptors and ensure that all are
# unique. If the number requested is greater that the 10%, it will be reduced
# to 10% of the total possible number of descriptors.
#
# Column Max Mut States: is the number of states that can be mutated in a descriptor.
#
# Column param2 & param3: are reserved, doing nothing for the moment.
