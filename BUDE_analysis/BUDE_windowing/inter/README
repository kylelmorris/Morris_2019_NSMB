# All these commands can be called in sequence from a master script,
# but these are the individual processes required:
# In the directory above this one you need to run the script
bash setup.sh
# in order to get the PDB file clean and also converted to mol2 for 
# part of the subsequent processing

# Next we define the windows with:
bin/mk_wins < ../hub_padded_80.pdb
# run in this directory and prodcing the file: all_windows.txt
#
# N.B. If the BUDE executable, bude, is intalled in a non standard
# location (and is not in your path) you will need to add the 
# location in the file: run_bude_scan.sh
# Now run the bude scanning job, either interactively
bash run_bude_scan.sh > window_5_inter-hub.out
# Or protected in the background
# nohup bash run_bude_scan.sh > window_5_inter-hub.out &
#
# When that is done (about 45 mins), split the output into the seperate chains
bash  split_results.sh
# This puts the energy per window data in sub-directory: windows/
#
# Plotting the results:
# gnuplot must be installed
# ps2pdf also, if you want pdfs
# gimp if you want to convert the postscript to .ps to .png files
cd plots
bash do_plot.sh
cd ../
